# NixOS on the HoneyComb / ClearFog LX2k

This repo contains minimal viable Nix expressions for NixOS installer images and UEFI
firmwares for the following machines:

* [HoneyComb LX2K][lx2k-store]

# Prerequisites

Before starting, you should ensure you have:

* Any additional required hardware is properly installed.
* A Linux machine with Nix installed.
  If not on an aarch64 machine, set this (or equivalent): 
  ```nix
  # /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
  boot.binfmt.emulatedSystems = [ "aarch64-linux" ];
  ```
* FTDI drivers configured according to [instructions](https://developer.solid-run.com/knowledge-base/serial-connection/).
  (NixOS default kernel users are already covered!)
* A microUSB to USB cable. ([Ex][parts-microusb-to-usb-cable-ex])
* A microSD card. ([Ex][parts-microsd-card-ex])
* A USB stick, 4+ GB prefered. ([Ex][parts-usb-stick-ex])

# Usage

These machines require both a UEFI image (typically loaded on the microSD card) as well as an
installer image (typically loaded on a USB stick).

To get started, build the required images:

> If you have a different RAM speed than `3200`, choose that speed instead.
> (Eg. `nix-build -A lx2k.uefi.ddr-2400 -o uefi.img`)

```bash
nix-build -A lx2k.isoImage -o isoImage
nix-build -A lx2k.uefi.ddr-3200 -o uefi.img
```

Use `lsblk` to take a look at the block devices within `/dev`:

```bash
$ lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,MODEL,SERIAL,STATE
NAME          SIZE MODEL                     SERIAL             STATE
sda         465.8G Samsung_SSD_860_EVO_500GB S3Z1NB0K431062D    running
└─sda1      465.8G                                              
sdb           7.5G USB_Flash_Drive           AASB9S2CIA58DPXH   running # <-- USB Stick
sdc         238.9G UHSII_uSD_Reader          201912001648       running # <-- microSD card
nvme1n1     349.3G INTEL SSDPED1K375GA       PHKS750500HT375AGN live
├─nvme1n1p1   512M                                              
└─nvme1n1p2 348.8G                                                                                          
```

Then, copy the built images to those devices:

```bash
$ sudo cp -vi uefi.img /dev/sdc
cp: overwrite '/dev/sdc'? y
'uefi.img' -> '/dev/sdc'
$ sudo cp -vi isoImage/iso/*.iso /dev/sdb
cp: overwrite '/dev/sdb'? y
'isoImage/iso/nixos-21.03pre263901.68398d2dd50-aarch64-linux.iso' -> '/dev/sdb'
```

# Booting

Plug the microUSB side of the microUSB cable into the port which registers `dmesg` as `FTDI`, not the `STM32`
(see step 2). Plug the other side into the host machine with FTDI drivers.

```bash
$ dmesg | grep FTDI
# ...
[...] usb 3-3: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0
```

Plug the microUSB side of the microUSB cable into the port labelled CONSOLE (not 
"MANAGEMENT") on the board. It should show in `dmesg` as `FTDI`, not `STM32`.

```bash
$ nix-shell -p picocom --run "sudo picocom /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200"
picocom v3.2a

port is        : /dev/ttyUSB0
flowcontrol    : none
baudrate is    : 115200
parity is      : none
databits are   : 8
stopbits are   : 1

noinit is      : no
noreset is     : no
hangup is      : no

send_cmd is    : /nix/store/91ycwnp2a7qa37lzjfgvvwlzq161qprs-lrzsz-0.12.20/bin/sz -vv
receive_cmd is : rz -vv -E
imap is        : 
omap is        : 
emap is        : crcrlf,delbs,
logfile is     : none
initstring     : none
exit_after is  : not set
exit is        : no

```

Next the fun part! **Hit the power button 🚀!**

With any luck, something similar to the following will show:

```bash
# ...

NOTICE:  Welcome to LX2160 BL31 Phase

UEFI firmware built at 00:00:00 on Jan  1 1980. version:

SOC: LX2160ACE Rev2.0 (0x87360020)
UEFI firmware (version  built at 00:00:00 on Jan  1 1980)
```

After, a UEFI boot menu will be presented. From here, proceed like a normal NixOS install.

# Notes

* `make menuconfig`

  Requires some dependencies:

  ```bash
  nix-shell -E 'with (import <nixpkgs> {}); stdenv.mkDerivation { name = "fake"; nativeBuildInputs = [ ncurses pkgconfig bison flex ]; }'

  export NIX_CFLAGS_LINK=$(pkg-config --libs ncurses)
  ```
# Future work

* **TODO:** Improve self-hosting
  + Determine which of =boot.kernelParams= are important and move them to
    a module that can be included by installed systems.
* Why is 2gb of memory allocated to huge pages?
* Does the PCI-E slot work?
* Discuss installation steps onto eMCC
* Create joined sdcard/isoimage for flashing to sdcards.
  + Add entry in UEFI for recovery with this image.
